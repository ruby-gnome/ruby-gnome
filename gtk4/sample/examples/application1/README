Step 1: A trivial application

To make gnome-shell use the desktop file and icon for this example
while running it uninstalled, do the following:

mkdir -p ~/.local/share/applications
sed -e "s#@bindir@#$PWD#" org.gtk.exampleapp.desktop \
  > ~/.local/share/applications/org.gtk.exampleapp.desktop

mkdir -p ~/.local/share/icons/hicolor/48x48/apps
cp exampleapp.png ~/.local/share/icons/hicolor/48x48/apps

Note:
1. You need to nstall your exampleapp.rb in advance.

$ cp exampleapp.rb $HOME/.local/bin/exampleapp.rb
$ chmod 755 $HOME/.local/bin/exampleapp.rb

2. If you use rbenv, your ruby executable may not be found by /bin/sh.
You can solve this by creating a symbolic link in $HOME/.local/bin to your ruby executable.

For example,

$ cd $HOME/.local/bin
$ ln -s $HOME/.rbenv/versions/3.1.2/bin/ruby ruby
