<h2>Overview</h2><div class="docstring">
  <div class="discussion">
    
<p>A GDatagram::Based is a networking interface for representing datagram-based communications. It is a more or less direct mapping of the core parts of the BSD socket API in a portable GObject interface. It is implemented by #GSocket, which wraps the UNIX socket API on UNIX and winsock2 on Windows.</p>

<p>GDatagram::Based is entirely platform independent, and is intended to be used alongside higher-level networking APIs such as #GIOStream.</p>

<p>It uses vectored scatter/gather I/O by default, allowing for many messages to be sent or received in a single call. Where possible, implementations of the interface should take advantage of vectored I/O to minimise processing or system calls. For example, #GSocket uses recvmmsg() and sendmmsg() where possible. Callers should take advantage of scatter/gather I/O (the use of multiple buffers per message) to avoid unnecessary copying of data to assemble or disassemble a message.</p>

<p>Each GDatagram::Based operation has a timeout parameter which may be negative for blocking behaviour, zero for non-blocking behaviour, or positive for timeout behaviour. A blocking operation blocks until finished or there is an error. A non-blocking operation will return immediately with a %G_IO_ERROR_WOULD_BLOCK error if it cannot make progress. A timeout operation will block until the operation is complete or the timeout expires; if the timeout expires it will return what progress it made, or %G_IO_ERROR_TIMED_OUT if no progress was made. To know when a call would successfully run you can call g_datagram_based_condition_check() or g_datagram_based_condition_wait(). You can also use g_datagram_based_create_source() and attach it to a GMain::Context to get callbacks when I/O is possible.</p>

<p>When running a non-blocking operation applications should always be able to handle getting a %G_IO_ERROR_WOULD_BLOCK error even when some other function said that I/O was possible. This can easily happen in case of a race condition in the application, but it can also happen for other reasons. For instance, on Windows a socket is always seen as writable until a write returns %G_IO_ERROR_WOULD_BLOCK.</p>

<p>As with #GSocket, GDatagram::Baseds can be either connection oriented (for example, SCTP) or connectionless (for example, UDP). GDatagram::Baseds must be datagram-based, not stream-based. The interface does not cover connection establishment — use methods on the underlying type to establish a connection before sending and receiving data through the GDatagram::Based API. For connectionless socket types the target/source address is specified or received in each I/O operation.</p>

<p>Like most other APIs in GLib, GDatagram::Based is not inherently thread safe. To use a GDatagram::Based concurrently from multiple threads, you must implement your own locking.</p>

<p>Checks on the readiness of <strong>datagram_based</strong> to perform operations. The operations specified in <strong>condition</strong> are checked for and masked against the currently-satisfied conditions on <strong>datagram_based</strong>. The result is returned.</p>

<p>%G_IO_IN will be set in the return value if data is available to read with g_datagram_based_receive_messages(), or if the connection is closed remotely (EOS); and if the datagram_based has not been closed locally using some implementation-specific method (such as g_socket_close() or g_socket_shutdown() with <strong>shutdown_read</strong> set, if it’s a #GSocket).</p>

<p>If the connection is shut down or closed (by calling g_socket_close() or g_socket_shutdown() with <strong>shutdown_read</strong> set, if it’s a #GSocket, for example), all calls to this function will return %G_IO_ERROR_CLOSED.</p>

<p>%G_IO_OUT will be set if it is expected that at least one byte can be sent using g_datagram_based_send_messages() without blocking. It will not be set if the datagram_based has been closed locally.</p>

<p>%G_IO_HUP will be set if the connection has been closed locally.</p>

<p>%G_IO_ERR will be set if there was an asynchronous error in transmitting data previously enqueued using g_datagram_based_send_messages().</p>

<p>Note that on Windows, it is possible for an operation to return %G_IO_ERROR_WOULD_BLOCK even immediately after g_datagram_based_condition_check() has claimed that the GDatagram::Based is ready for writing. Rather than calling g_datagram_based_condition_check() and then writing to the GDatagram::Based if it succeeds, it is generally better to simply try writing right away, and try again later if the initial attempt returns %G_IO_ERROR_WOULD_BLOCK.</p>

<p>It is meaningless to specify %G_IO_ERR or %G_IO_HUP in <strong>condition</strong>; these conditions will always be set in the output if they are true. Apart from these flags, the output is guaranteed to be masked by <strong>condition</strong>.</p>

<p>Receive one or more data messages from <strong>datagram_based</strong> in one go.</p>

<p><strong>messages</strong> must point to an array of GInput::Message structs and <strong>num_messages</strong> must be the length of this array. Each GInput::Message contains a pointer to an array of GInput::Vector structs describing the buffers that the data received in each message will be written to.</p>

<p><strong>flags</strong> modify how all messages are received. The commonly available arguments for this are available in the GSocket::MsgFlags enum, but the values there are the same as the system values, and the flags are passed in as-is, so you can pass in system-specific flags too. These flags affect the overall receive operation. Flags affecting individual messages are returned in GInput::Message.flags.</p>

<p>The other members of GInput::Message are treated as described in its documentation.</p>

<p>If <strong>timeout</strong> is negative the call will block until <strong>num_messages</strong> have been received, the connection is closed remotely (EOS), <strong>cancellable</strong> is cancelled, or an error occurs.</p>

<p>If <strong>timeout</strong> is 0 the call will return up to <strong>num_messages</strong> without blocking, or %G_IO_ERROR_WOULD_BLOCK if no messages are queued in the operating system to be received.</p>

<p>If <strong>timeout</strong> is positive the call will block on the same conditions as if <strong>timeout</strong> were negative. If the timeout is reached before any messages are received, %G_IO_ERROR_TIMED_OUT is returned, otherwise it will return the number of messages received before timing out. (Note: This is effectively the behaviour of ‘MSG_WAITFORONE` with recvmmsg().)</p>

<p>To be notified when messages are available, wait for the %G_IO_IN condition. Note though that you may still receive %G_IO_ERROR_WOULD_BLOCK from g_datagram_based_receive_messages() even if you were previously notified of a %G_IO_IN condition.</p>

<p>If the remote peer closes the connection, any messages queued in the underlying receive buffer will be returned, and subsequent calls to g_datagram_based_receive_messages() will return 0 (with no error set).</p>

<p>If the connection is shut down or closed (by calling g_socket_close() or g_socket_shutdown() with <strong>shutdown_read</strong> set, if it’s a #GSocket, for example), all calls to this function will return %G_IO_ERROR_CLOSED.</p>

<p>On error -1 is returned and <strong>error</strong> is set accordingly. An error will only be returned if zero messages could be received; otherwise the number of messages successfully received before the error will be returned. If <strong>cancellable</strong> is cancelled, %G_IO_ERROR_CANCELLED is returned as with any other error.</p>

<p>To be notified when messages can be sent, wait for the %G_IO_OUT condition. Note though that you may still receive %G_IO_ERROR_WOULD_BLOCK from g_datagram_based_send_messages() even if you were previously notified of a %G_IO_OUT condition. (On Windows in particular, this is very common due to the way the underlying APIs work.)</p>

<p>If the connection is shut down or closed (by calling g_socket_close() or g_socket_shutdown() with <strong>shutdown_write</strong> set, if it’s a #GSocket, for example), all calls to this function will return %G_IO_ERROR_CLOSED.</p>

<p>On error -1 is returned and <strong>error</strong> is set accordingly. An error will only be returned if zero messages could be sent; otherwise the number of messages successfully sent before the error will be returned. If <strong>cancellable</strong> is cancelled, %G_IO_ERROR_CANCELLED is returned as with any other error.</p>
